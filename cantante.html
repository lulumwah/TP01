<h1><i><b>Say yes to haeven</b></i></h1>
<h2><i>Lana del rey</i></h2>
<p>If you dance, I'll dance<br>
    And if you don't, I'll dance anyway<br> 
    Give peace a chance<br>
    Let the fear you have fall away
</p> 

<p>I've got my eye on you<br>
    I've got my eye on you</p>

<p>Say yes to Heaven<br>
    Say yes to me<br>
    Say yes to Heaven<br>
    Say yes to me</p>
<br>If you go, I'll stay

<p>You come back, I'll be right here<br>
    Like a barge at sea<br>
    In the storm, I stay clear</p>

<p>'Cause I've got my mind on you<br>
    I've got my mind on you</p>

<p>Say yes to Heaven<br>
    Say yes to me<br>
    Say yes to Heaven<br>
    Say yes to me</p>

<p>If you dance, I'll dance<br>
    I'll put my red dress on, get it on<br>
    And if you fight, I'll fight<br>
    It doesn't matter, now it's all gone</p>

<p>I've got my mind on you<br>
    I got my mind on you</p>

<p>Say yes to Heaven<br>
    Say yes to me<br>
    Say yes to Heaven<br>
    Say yes to me</p>

<p>I've got my eye on you<br>
    I've got my eye on you, <sub>mm</sub><br>
    I've got my eye on you<br>
    I've got my eye on you</p>
